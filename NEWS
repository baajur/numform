----------------------------------------------------------------

Format numbers for publication; includes the removal of leading zeros,
standardization of number of digits, addition of affixes, and a p-value
formatter.  These tools combine the functionality of several 'base' functions
such as paste(), format(), and sprintf() into specific use case functions that
are named in a way that is consistent with usage, making their names easy to
remember and easy to deploy.
